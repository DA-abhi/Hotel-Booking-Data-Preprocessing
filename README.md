# Hotel-Booking-Data-Preprocessing

This project involved cleaning, transforming, and preparing a large hotel booking dataset for analysis using Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Key steps included:
* Handling missing values (e.g., children, country, agent, company).
* Creating new features like total_guests and total_stays.
* Converting and standardizing date formats.
* Ensuring data quality for robust insights.
* Excited about the clean dataset ready for predictive modeling and visualization!
